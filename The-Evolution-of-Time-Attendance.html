                        </h6>

                        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">Time-Attendance system has evolved greatly over the years.
                            Organizations started with manual methods of keeping attendance data of their employees.
                            Recording attendance details in registers manually was one among the foremost common
                            Time-Attendance keeping methods employed by organizations. However, like any manual process,
                            such attendance records were susceptible to being erroneous. Erroneous attendance data
                            records results in erroneous payment of salary. As a result, manual time keeping results in
                            lot of confusions when it involves accurate and error free attendance records.</p>
                        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">From simple methods like entering entry and exit timings into a
                            register, the attendance system evolved to time clocks and timecards. For a short time, the
                            time clocks and timecards served well for the workers, as these were upgraded methods;
                            better than the manual entering of attendance data. However, inconsistencies and
                            inaccuracies were not far behind with these methods also. Many issues faced by employers
                            associated with employee attendance continued. Eventually, with the event of technology,
                            came into picture biometric methods of recording attendance of employees. This method has,
                            since its introduction, only been updated and proven highly effective and accurate method of
                            collecting attendance data.</p>
                        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">However, allow us to run through the explanations intimately that led
                            to development of biometric methods for attendance marking.</p>
                        <ul class="text-muted p-0" style="list-style-type: none;">
                            <li class="mt-4">
                                <span class="fs-4 fw-semibold text-muted">Human Errors:</span>
                                <p class="mt-4 text-muted">Manual attendance systems left the attendance data hospitable
                                    manipulation. Employees many an times tampered with their attendance records so as
                                    to hide up for his or her loss hours. Alternatively, HR people often entered false
                                    attendance data into the payroll software. Such mistakes may go unnoticed, but it
                                    indirectly affected the value to company and resulted in incorrect pay to employees.
                                    Moreover, the task of manually collecting attendance of each employee itself was a
                                    time-consuming process for the HR personnel. Hence, humane errors became one among
                                    the main reasons for the event of biometric attendance systems.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="mt-4">
                                <span class="fs-4 fw-semibold text-muted">Buddy punching:</span>
                                <p class="mt-4 text-muted">Time sheets and punch cards were easy to by-pass items. With
                                    such easy methods of marking attendance in a location where, employees often
                                    resorted to malpractices like time theft and buddy punching. As a matter of fact,
                                    buddy punching became one among the main issues faced by organizations with
                                    reference to attendance. Employees could easily mark attendance for his or her
                                    friends and colleagues using their punch cards or time sheets when marking their own
                                    attendance. Introduction of automated and biometric based attendance management
                                    software was a serious help in overcoming the difficulty of buddy punching.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="mt-4">

                                <span class="fs-4 fw-semibold text-muted">Inefficient:</span>
                                <p class="mt-4 text-muted">One of the opposite major reasons for the expansion of
                                    biometric attendance systems lies within the inefficiency of your time sheets and
                                    time clocks. As mentioned above, these methods are highly susceptible to errors
                                    which can cost the business or organization enormous amount of your time and money.
                                    Moreover, with rapid climb of business environment across the world, employee count
                                    has also increased to an excellent extent. Hence, managing attendance details of a
                                    little number of employees through manual methods was still plausible. However,
                                    managing attendance details and accurate payroll processing of an outsized number of
                                    employees became difficult. It only leads to inaccuracy.</p>
                                <p class="mt-4 text-muted">As we will see, several reasons played a task within the
                                    development of biometric technology. Biometrics is exclusive to every individual,
                                    which is why they create an accurate method of collecting attendance data. Since
                                    every individual features a unique biometric, the matter of buddy punching gets
                                    automatically eliminated. Furthermore, implementing biometric attendance methods
                                    makes it smooth and straightforward for HR personnel while processing payroll of the
                                    workers. because the processing of attendance data and payroll processing becomes
                                    smooth, productivity of HR department increases and improves an excellent deal.</p>
                                <p class="mt-4 text-muted">Another major advantage that modern-day biometric attendance
                                    systems provide is that the employee management software. This software allows
                                    employees to see their attendance or leave details on the online based portal
                                    available. alongside attendance and leave details, employees also can apply for
                                    leaves or tours and check the status of their application also. Hence, the software
                                    makes conducting many daily activities quite easy for the workers. Moreover, even
                                    the managerial authorities can enjoy this software. they will easily check the
                                    attendance/leave/tour details and applications of their employees over the portal.
                                    Furthermore, they will accept or reject the applications over the portal itself,
                                    making it easier for both.</p>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-muted">To conclude, the expansion of biometric attendance systems was
                            gradual and far appreciated. this technique was developed keeping in mind every problem that
                            organizations faced with reference to time-attendance details of their employees. Hence,
                            these Time-Attendance Systems have demonstrated very helpful and effective for organizations
                            in overcoming the attendance related issues.</p>
